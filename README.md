# PHP E-commerce Website

## Overview
This project, developed during my third year of college, is a **PHP-based e-commerce website** designed to sell electronic products and accessories. The platform is aimed at providing a user-friendly, secure, and accessible interface for purchasing essential components like microcontrollers, microprocessors, sensors, PCs, and headphones. The website primarily serves students in electronics and computer science, offering them a reliable space to shop for their technical needs.

## Features
- **Product Management**: Admins can add, update, and manage products and accessories.
- **Shopping Cart**: Customers can easily add products to the cart and proceed to checkout.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system for customers to manage their accounts.
- **Order Management**: Users can track their orders, view past purchases, and check order statuses.
- **Search and Filter**: An intuitive search bar and filtering options allow users to browse products by categories or keywords.

## Technologies Used
- **PHP**: Server-side scripting language used for dynamic content generation and backend operations.
- **MySQL**: Database management system to store product, user, and order data.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Front-end technologies for creating a responsive, interactive user interface.

## Development Process
The project was developed through multiple stages, each focused on building essential features and functionality:
1. **Planning**: Defining project scope and outlining user requirements.
2. **Design**: Creating wireframes and layout prototypes for the website's user interface.
3. **Implementation**: Developing both the front-end and back-end components, integrating them with a functional database.
4. **Testing**: Performing rigorous tests to ensure the website is secure, bug-free, and fully functional before deployment.

## Challenges
- Designing and implementing a **secure login system** to protect user data and transactions.
- Developing a robust **product management system** that supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
- Optimizing the website for **responsiveness** across different devices and screen sizes.
- Ensuring smooth integration between **front-end** and **back-end** components.
